### **About / 关于我**
Qi She (佘琪) leads the Applied Algorithm & Foundation team at ByteDance Business Integrity, where he spearheads the large-scale industrialization of **Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)** and **Agentic Foundation** capabilities. Since 2023, his work has focused on the end-to-end deployment of AI Agents.

A 2018 Ph.D. graduate from City University of Hong Kong and a former visiting scholar at Princeton, Qi was honored with the 2025 CityU **Young Alumni Award** for his professional excellence. Previously, as a Research Scientist at Intel Labs, he received the 2020 Intel **Gordy Award**—the lab's highest honor named after Gordon Moore. His long-term research in Generative Models and Representation Learning has been extensively published in premier venues including **TPAMI, NeurIPS, ICLR，ICML, CVPR, and ICCV**.

### **Recent Focus / 工作方向**
Focusing on the industrial-scale deployment of Agentic AI within ByteDance’s Business Integrity ecosystem:
- **Architecting Agentic Foundations**: Developing specialized (M)LLMs optimized for reasoning, planning, and autonomous decision-making in high-stakes security scenarios.
- **Scaling Autonomous Agents**: Leading the end-to-end integration of Multi-Agent systems to handle massive real-time traffic, ensuring robustness and alignment with evolving safety policies.
- **Advancing MLLM-Agent Synergy**: Pioneering the fusion of (M)LLMs with agentic workflows to solve complex, fine-grained content understanding challenges at scale.
